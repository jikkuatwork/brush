# Bursh

Simple app for making logos.

## 99

Built as an experiment to see how fast a useful app can be built. The initial
target was to spend only 99 minutes for this idea. But it took around tripple
that to finish it (in discontinous bits).

I believe an app in 99 minutes is not as ludicrous as it sounds with today's AI
tools like Bolt & Cursor. [More Info](https://jikkujose.in/startups/2024/12/11/99.html)
